# Codemetrics for JAR Files
implementation of a tool which checks the amount of methods, interfaces, etc.  

## Eclipse Project
in my run configuration in Eclipse there are 2 arguments:  
heap.jar  
spring-web-5.0.5.RELEASE.jar  
to run it properly.  
These files are in the root directory of the project.
